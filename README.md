# Custom-Flutter-Templates
This is used to replace your current flutter app template upon "flutter create"

# How To Use:

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Locate your downloaded flutter install folder and navigate to {your-flutter-install}/packages/flutter-tools/templates/app/
  3. Delete the "lib" folder and replace with this repository's "lib" folder
      - If you decide in the future you want to revert to the original do the this step with the "lib [ORIGINAL]" folder or "flutter upgrade"
  4. Add "assets.tmpl" folder
  5. Add "pubspec.yaml" file
  6. [OPTIONAL] Copy *your* .vscode folder
      - This is nice to keep your emulator configurations/settings consitent throughout your projects
